            I did it after I was done with the basic HTML and CSS. Here, SASS
            was used for styling instead of vanilla CSS. SASS truly gives wings
            to CSS. Learnt neat tricks here and there. This project was also
            more about management and maintenance. As such, BEM model was
            employed to write the markup. I hadn't learnt JavaScript yet and it
            is as simple as it gets. Despite the looks, CSS grid and flexbox
            were not used; thus, it was completed using the more traditional way
            of building websites. SASS did wonders when it came to making it
            responsive.

          <p>
            It was built using Node (Express) and MongoDB for database. Features
            include authentication, authorization, image upload, auto emails,
            online payments, review system and more. It is complete in a sense
            that I was introduced to lots of topics that make up the modern web
            devlopment. The MVC architecure was used to develop this project.

            the front-end portion of the project, which I must say does not
            feature the API entirely. To be honest, it is not even responsive so
            I higly recommend that you open it on larger screens. And finally,
            the GitHub repo can be found

            Here, I used my skills from the API project for the backend. React
            powers the frontend with Redux for state management. Bootstrap was
            used for styling. As such it is client side rendered. This project
            was more about testing my then newly acquired React knowledge and
            tying it together with the backend. Both the aspects of the project
            run on the same server. I didn't "feel the heat" as I was just
            revising the whole development process. Overall, this project was
            more about testing my skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is no documentation for this one as it was more about bringing
            React into the mix. The client features the API completely. The
            entire site can be viewed
            <a href="https://kashop.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
            Similarly, the GitHub repo for this project is located
            <a href="https://github.com/karuifeather/kashop" target="_blank"
              >here</a

          <p>
            This has inspirations from Codepen and Jupyter Notebook, only in
            this case we use it for JavaScript. Users can write code and run in
            on the spot. Importing of various modules from NPM is also
            supported. One can write React code as well. Basically, it has all
            the writing and running aspect of writing code. Features like saving
            and multiple tabs are planned but not yet implemented. Also, there's
            no server involved. Everything happens on users' brower. Yes, even
            the compiling.
          </p>

          <p>
            I did this immediately after learning TypeScript and as such
            employed its features as much as possible. Unlike with JS, this time
            the development process was not so much about referencing the code
            repeatatively. With a little more work, TS certainly eased the
            process. I can say honestly that I enjoyed writing the code for the
            project.

          <p>
            This is the simplest project when compared to the others ones I
            worked on. But in the world of Computer Science, that's does not
            mean anything unless it's another "Hello World!" program. The main
            goal of this project was to learn NextJS.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the process, I got to learn about handling Markdown files. I used
            the ever popular Remark to process the markdowns which were just
            copied from a third party site. Overall, a neat little project to
            learn to build server side rendered React sites.
